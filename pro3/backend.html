    <p>
        Back-end development means working on server-side software, which focuses on everything you can’t see on a
        website. Back-end developers ensure the website performs correctly, focusing on databases, back-end logic,
        application programming interface (APIs), architecture, and servers. They use code that helps browsers
        communicate with databases, store, understand, and delete data.</p >
        <p>
            On a team, back-end developers collaborate with front-end developers, product managers, principal architects, and website testers to build the structure of a website or mobile app. Back-end developers must be familiar with many kinds of tools and frameworks, including languages such as Python, Java, and Ruby. They make sure the back-end performs quickly and responsively to front-end user requests.
        </p>

        </b></h2>
        <p>
            Back-end developers are required to have technical expertise, analytical thinking, and excellent collaboration skills. As a back-end web developer, you should be able to work independently to design the web infrastructure. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Here’s what many back-end developers do on a day-to-day basis:
        </p>
        <ul type="disk">
            <li>Build and maintain websites: 
                A back-end developer’s main responsibility is to use various tools, frameworks, and languages to determine how best to develop intuitive, user-friendly prototypes and turn them into websites. This requires an understanding of cross-platform functionality and compatibility.
            </li>
            <li>Write high-quality code: 
                To produce sustainable web applications, developers must write clean and easily maintainable code.
            </li>
            <li>Perform quality assurance (QA) testing: 
                Create and oversee testing schedules to optimize user interface and experience, ensuring optimal display on various browsers and devices.

           </li>
            <li>Assess efficiency and speed: 
                Once a website is up and running, and during updates and edits, developers need to assess its performance and scalability, adjusting code as necessary.
            </li>
            <li>Troubleshoot and debug: 
                Be able to troubleshoot issues and resolve them, while communicating them to project managers, stakeholders, and QA teams.
            </li>
            <li>Train and support: 
                Maintain workflows with client teams to ensure ongoing support, along with leading training and mentorship for junior developers.
            </li>
        </ul>
