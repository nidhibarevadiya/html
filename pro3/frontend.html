    <p>A front-end developer, usually referred to as a front-end web developer, is a specialist in charge of creating
        the interface. For them to use the application in question, the users need this interface. A web designer is a
        specialist who develops the look and layout of websites. Additionally, the front-end developer uses coding
        languages like CSS, HTML, and JavaScript to ensure that the design functions online.</p>

    <p>
        For the time being, let's define what a front-end developer, back-end developer, and full stack developer are.
        Be aware that there is a current trend for the distinction between front end and back end development to get
        blurrier. primarily because front end developers are increasingly doing many of the responsibilities that
        traditionally fell under the purview of back-end developers.
    </p>
    <p>
        There are also full-stack engineers, as a side note. They are experienced project managers who are full-stack
        developers who are skilled in the disciplines of configuring, managing, and maintaining computer networks and
        systems.
