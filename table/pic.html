                    live happier, healthier, and more productive lives are also creating new challenges for citizens and
                    governments around the world. From election meddling to data breaches and cyberattacks, recent

                    factories, where they are used to carry items or change the orientation of objects for easier
                    assembly or processing. They are generally classified by type: "suction hands" or grasping hands.
