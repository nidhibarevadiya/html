        Today we live in a digital era where all aspects of our lives depend on the network, computer and other
        electronic devices, and software applications. All critical infrastructure such as the banking system,
        healthcare, financial institutions, governments, and manufacturing industries use devices connected to the
        Internet as a core part of their operations. Some of their information, such as intellectual property, financial
        data, and personal data, can be sensitive for unauthorized access or exposure that could have negative
        consequences. This information gives intruders and threat actors to infiltrate them for financial gain,
        extortion, political or social motives, or just vandalism.

        Cyber-attack is now an international concern that hacks the system, and other security attacks could endanger
        the global economy. Therefore, it is essential to have an excellent cybersecurity strategy to protect sensitive
        information from high-profile security breaches. Furthermore, as the volume of cyber-attacks grows, companies
        and organizations, especially those that deal with information related to national security, health, or
        financial records, need to use strong cybersecurity measures and processes to protect their sensitive business
        and personal information.

        Cybersecurity is the protection of Internet-connected systems, including hardware, software, and data from cyber
        attackers. It is primarily about people, processes, and technologies working together to encompass the full
        range of threat reduction, vulnerability reduction, deterrence, international engagement, and recovery policies
        and activities, including computer network operations, information assurance, law enforcement, etc.

        We can break the CIA model into three parts: Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability. It is actually a
        security model that helps people to think about various parts of IT security. Let us discuss each part in
        detail.

    <h2> <b>
            <font face="Serif" size="5" color="4535C1">Confidentiality</font>
        </b></h2>
    <p>
        Confidentiality is equivalent to privacy that avoids unauthorized access of information. It involves ensuring
        the data is accessible by those who are allowed to use it and blocking access to others. It prevents essential
        information from reaching the wrong people. Data encryption is an excellent example of ensuring confidentiality.

    <h2> <b>
            <font face="Serif" size="5" color="4535C1">Integrity</font>
        </b></h2>
    <p>
        This principle ensures that the data is authentic, accurate, and safeguarded from unauthorized modification by
        threat actors or accidental user modification. If any modifications occur, certain measures should be taken to
        protect the sensitive data from corruption or loss and speedily recover from such an event. In addition, it
        indicates to make the source of information genuine.
    </p>

    <h2> <b>
            <font face="Serif" size="5" color="4535C1">Availability</font>
        </b></h2>
    <p>
        This principle makes the information to be available and useful for its authorized people always. It ensures
        that these accesses are not hindered by system malfunction or cyber-attacks.
