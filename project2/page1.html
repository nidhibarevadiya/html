    <p>
        The technique of protecting internet-connected systems such as computers, servers, mobile devices, electronic
        systems, networks, and data from malicious attacks is known as cybersecurity. We can divide cybersecurity into
        two parts one is cyber, and the other is security. Cyber refers to the technology that includes systems,
        networks, programs, and data. And security is concerned with the protection of systems, networks, applications,
        and information. In some cases, it is also called electronic information security or information technology
        security.

        </b></h2>
    <p>
        Every organization's assets are the combinations of a variety of different systems. These systems have a strong
        cybersecurity posture that requires coordinated efforts across all of its systems. Therefore, we can categorize
        cybersecurity in the following sub-domains:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Network Security:
            it involves implementing the hardware and software to secure a computer network from unauthorized access,
            intruders, attacks, disruption, and misuse. This security helps an organization to protect its assets
            against external and internal threats.
        </li>

        <li>Application Security:
            It deals with the processes, monitoring, alerts, and plans to how an organization responds when any
            malicious activity is causing the loss of operations or data. Its policies dictate resuming the lost
            operations after any disaster happens to the same operating capacity as before the event.
        </li>
        <li>Information or Data Security:
            It involves protecting the software and devices from unwanted threats. This protection can be done by
            constantly updating the apps to ensure they are secure from attacks. Successful security begins in the
            design stage, writing source code, validation, threat modeling, etc., before a program or device is
            deployed.</li>
        <li>Identity management:
            It involves implementing a strong data storage mechanism to maintain the integrity and privacy of data, both
            in storage and in transit.
        </li>
        <li>Operational Security:
            It involves processing and making decisions on handling and securing data assets.
        </li>
        <li>Mobile Security:
            It involves securing the organizational and personal data stored on mobile devices such as cell phones,
            computers, tablets, and other similar devices against various malicious threats. These threats are
            unauthorized access, device loss or theft, malware, etc.
        </li>
        <li>Cloud Security:
            t involves in protecting the information stored in the digital environment or cloud architectures for the
            organization. It uses various cloud service providers such as AWS, Azure, Google, etc., to ensure security
            against multiple threats. </li>
        <li>Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity Planning:
            It deals with the processes, monitoring, alerts, and plans to how an organization responds when any
            malicious activity is causing the loss of operations or data. Its policies dictate resuming the lost
            operations after any disaster happens to the same operating capacity as before the event.
        </li>
        <li>User Education:
            It deals with the processes, monitoring, alerts, and plans to how an organization responds when any
            malicious activity is causing the loss of operations or data. Its policies dictate resuming the lost
            operations after any disaster happens to the same operating capacity as before the event.
